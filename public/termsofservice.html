    <p>We&rsquo;re on a mission to close the gender pay gap. We&rsquo;re here to help parents understand and budget for the costs that often prevent women from returning to the workforce and participating fully postpartum. And it&rsquo;s not just up to individual women: we&rsquo;re here to help <em>everyone </em>navigate parental leave policies and work with their employers. Mirza&rsquo;s services are designed to help parents make more informed decisions about family and career choices.</p>
    <p>This User Agreement and all related policies mentioned herein apply to individuals who agree to participate in beta testing (&ldquo;Beta Testing&rdquo;) of HeyMirza-branded apps, and any other HeyMirza-related sites, apps, communications and related services.

Beta Testing will occur in a production environment for the purpose of testing functionality and user experience including user behavior and prior to the commercial release of HeyMirza services. Our pricing may change, and we may make pricing changes at any time without notice.</p>
